## Nmap

We can see that there are some email services like pop and imap. Then there is SMB service and we also have a DNS running along with the common SSH and HTTP service.

We'll start enumerating with SMB.

## SMB

We don't see any share there, also no unique user was found.
So let's move on to HTTP service.

## HTTP

When we visit the IP we get a normal `Apache2 Ubuntu Default` Page. So the first thing I did was to use gobuster

With that I was able to find the `/wordpress` directory. Since it's wordpress the very first thing I did was to run wpscan to see if it's vulnerable to something.

wpscan did find a vulnerablity and one user

I didn't had to exploit that vulnerability to get the shell on the system. On one of the blog post I found the comment saying the host is super vulnerable

So I ran a bruteforce attack against the user found and I was able to crack the password in few minutes.

`c0rrupt3d_brain:24992499`

Once I was able to log in, I directly went to edit the theme and there in `404.php` I found a note.

Once I copy pasted my [php reverse shell code](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) there I ran

```bash
➜ http http://192.168.56.103/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/404.php
```

and got the reverse shell on my listener which was started by running: `nc -nlvp 4444`

## Privilege escalation

Since I had the shell I decided to look into the user directory and guess what I found, the damn root password.

![](images/evm/root-pass.png)

The password was `willy26`. I did `su root` to become root

Kinda good beginner box.
